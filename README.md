# Web scraping experient 

## Introduction
Data is everywhere in the internet, but sometimes it could be time-consuming to collect and consolidate massive data manually from a particular website. Remember when I was a Business Analyst in eCommerce retail company, it came to my attention that category buyers/merchandizers always keep an eye to competitor website for planning competitive pricing strategy. As it is virtually impossible that the competitor would offer free API for others to scrape data arbitrarily, that's why web scraping (or so called 'web scrawling') becomes the alternative solution to handle such tedious task in business context.

Although web scraping is an effective way to collect data from other websites, **we should always crawl responsibly in the sense that the crawler does not hit the websites while respecting terms of use as regulated by the website owner.**

## Just for fun
As a e-shopaholic, I found myself excited to scrap product information from one of my favourite grocery shopping websites (Ztore 士多) in Hong Kong. This is also my first time to write a Python program using related packages and it is amazing to see how it works :)
